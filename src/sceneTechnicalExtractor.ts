      4. Equipment suggestions (lenses, stabilizers)
      5. Visual references (cinematic comparisons)
      6. Transition types between scenes
      7. Character actions synchronized with music
      
      Follow this structure:
      SCENE [N] - [DURATION]

Transform scene technical details into self-contained video production prompts. For each character reference, replace names with full physical descriptions using this format:
      "[Gender] [Age] [Height] [Species] with [Physical Features], wearing [Attire]".
      
      Example transformation:

      4. Color grading notes
      5. Special effects requirements
      6. Transition execution instructions
      7. Character descriptions and actions
      
      Character Requirements:
      1. Always use character descriptors instead of names
      2. Include key physical features from CHARACTER_DATA
      3. Maintain cinematic terminology from SCENE_DATA
      4. Merge scene and character details seamlessly
