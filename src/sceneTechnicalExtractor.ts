        **Role**: You're a professional music video director with expertise in storyboards and technical planning.  
        **Task**: Create a detailed technical script for a **3-minute maximum** music video based on the provided idea. Use **screenplay format without markdown**.  
        
        **Strict Instructions**:  
        1. **Structure**:  
           - Divide the video into **chronological scenes** (numbered) synchronized with song lyrics/musical segments.  
           - Each scene must include:  
             * **Exact duration** (seconds)  
             * **Shot type** (close-up, medium shot, American shot, wide shot, etc.)  
             * **Camera movement** (Steadicam, crane, dolly zoom, horizontal/vertical pan, etc.)  
             * **Visual aesthetic** (color palette, lighting, textures, post-production effects)  
             * **Scene transitions** (hard cut, fade, match cut, etc.)  
        
        2. **Characters**:  
           - List **all characters** (including extras and background actors) with:  
             * Detailed physical description (clothing, hairstyle, makeup, distinctive features)  
             * Specific behavior/actions in each scene where they appear  
             * Type of interaction with other characters or camera  
        
        3. **Mandatory Technical Details**:  
           - Specify **camera gear** suggested for each shot type (e.g., anamorphic lens for wide shots, gimbal stabilizer for tracking movements).  
           - Include **concrete visual references** (e.g., "lighting à la 'Blade Runner 2049' with blue neons and atmospheric smoke").  
        
        4. **Rules**:  
           - Prioritize visual impact over extended narrative.  
           - Use professional cinematography terminology.  
           - Avoid spoken dialogue (unless part of song lyrics).  
           - Ensure coherence between visual atmosphere and music genre.
           - Every scene must have a duration of either 5 or 10 seconds.
           - Plan accordingly the number of scenes given the total duration of the video. 
           - Optimal number of scenes: {meanScenes}.
        
        5. **Include Scenes with Live Musicians**:
           - At least two scenes must feature a visible band or musicians playing instruments that complement the main story.
           - Show how these musicians integrate into the video’s narrative or setting.

        Extract technical scene details as a JSON array.

        - "specialNotes" (any additional gear, safety, or creative note)
        
        **Important**:
        1. Preserve the **sceneNumber** from the script. If the script says "SCENE 1 - 10 seconds", interpret that as sceneNumber = 1 and duration = 10 seconds.
        2. Convert durations to approximate "startTime" and "endTime" in MM:SS, adding them sequentially so the entire video doesn't exceed {duration} seconds.
           - For example, if SCENE 1 has 10 seconds, it might be startTime="00:00", endTime="00:10".
           - SCENE 2 (30 seconds) might be startTime="00:20", endTime="00:50", etc.
        3. Do not skip any scenes. Return them in the same order.
        4. If a scene references location or certain camera gear, place that info under the correct fields. 
        5. Do not add or remove scenes; parse exactly from the script.

        Their name must match the script's name for the character.
        If there are references to a band or musicians, list each musician separately with details including their instrument, wardrobe, and any unique features.
        Maintain consistency with the script’s descriptions (or make the best assumptions if not explicitly stated).
        Use the provided song lyrics and tags as additional context when inferring character details.
        For the "imagePrompt" field:
        Synthesize all the character attributes (physical features, age, gender, height/build, distinctive features, wardrobe details, movement style, key accessories, and any scene-specific changes) into one complete, vivid visual description.
        The prompt should serve as a detailed instruction for a visual generator, clearly conveying how the character should appear in the music video.

        Include the image style, color palette, and lighting conditions to ensure the character fits seamlessly into the video's visual aesthetic.

        Transform the technical details of the scenes into production prompts including composition details, actions and camera movements. For **each scene** in the "Scene Data", generate **one object** with three attributes:

        - "prompt"
        - "charactersInScene"
        - "settingId"

        **Instructions**:

        1. **Number of prompts**: You must produce as many objects as there are scenes in the JSON. If there are 9 scenes, return 9 objects in an array.

        2. **Character references**:
          - In "prompt", replace each character name with a full physical description taken from CHARACTER_DATA.
          - If the character is a musician, mention their instrument in the prompt (e.g., "carrying a vintage acoustic guitar").
          - In "charactersInScene", list the characters present in the scene. **Ensure that the names are exactly as they appear in CHARACTER_DATA, without any modifications or additional descriptions.** If only one character is present, list only that character. If none is present, just leave an empty array.
          - If we are referring to a character that is not in CHARACTER_DATA, charactersInScene should not include it.

        3. **Scene details**:
          - Use the data from the scene (composition, shotType, cameraMovement, lightingSetup, colorPalette, etc.).
          - Create a prompt for every scene that summarizes what happens in the scene. These images will be presented sequentially and used to generate a short video where the videos will be stitched together. We are limited by the duration of video creation so we need these images to guide a universal feel that connects each scene and image to the prior and the following scene and image, thus creating a cohesive series of videos.
          - Add the duration of the scene in seconds in the field "duration", knowing that the scene we are referring to includes the start time and end time of the scene. Duration must be 5 or 10 seconds.

        4. **Precision**:
          - Use professional cinematography terminology (e.g., "close-up with shallow depth of field", "slow dolly in", "neon underlighting").
          - Mention the lens or camera gear from the scene data.

        5. **Integration**:
          - Integrate the "Script Context" only if it adds crucial narrative or visual detail.
          - For musician scenes, describe how the instruments and performance integrate with the shot.

        6. **Style and Tone**:
          - Maintain a consistent style and tone throughout the prompts.
          - Ensure that the prompts are detailed enough to guide the visual creation process

        7. **Output format**: 
          - Return a JSON array where each element corresponds to one scene.
