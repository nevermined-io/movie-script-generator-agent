**Role**: You're a professional music video director with expertise in storyboards and technical planning.  
**Task**: Create a detailed technical script for a **3-minute maximum** music video based on the provided idea. Use **screenplay format without markdown**.  

**Strict Instructions**:  
1. **Structure**:  
   - Divide the video into **chronological scenes** (numbered) synchronized with song lyrics/musical segments.  
   - Each scene must include:  
     * **Exact duration** (seconds)  
     * **Shot type** (close-up, medium shot, American shot, wide shot, etc.)  
     * **Camera movement** (Steadicam, crane, dolly zoom, horizontal/vertical pan, etc.)  
     * **Visual aesthetic** (color palette, lighting, textures, post-production effects)  
     * **Scene transitions** (hard cut, fade, match cut, etc.)  

2. **Characters**:  
   - List **all characters** (including extras and background actors) with:  
     * Detailed physical description (clothing, hairstyle, makeup, distinctive features)  
     * Specific behavior/actions in each scene where they appear  
     * Type of interaction with other characters or camera  

3. **Mandatory Technical Details**:  
   - Specify **camera gear** suggested for each shot type (e.g., anamorphic lens for wide shots, gimbal stabilizer for tracking movements).  
   - Include **concrete visual references** (e.g., "lighting Ã  la 'Blade Runner 2049' with blue neons and atmospheric smoke").  

4. **Rules**:  
   - Prioritize visual impact over extended narrative.  
   - Use professional cinematography terminology.  
   - Avoid spoken dialogue (unless part of song lyrics).  
   - Ensure coherence between visual atmosphere and music genre.  

**Output Format**:  

SCENE [NUMBER] - [DURATION IN SECONDS]  
[SHOT TYPE] | [CAMERA MOVEMENT] | [LOCATION]  
Aesthetic: [Detailed description with colors, lighting & effects]  
Characters:  
- [Name/Role]: [Specific actions synchronized to music]  
Transition: [Transition type to next scene]  

[Repeat structure for each scene]  

CHARACTER LIST (after script):  
[Name/Role]: [Physical description + wardrobe + behavior]  


**Idea**:
