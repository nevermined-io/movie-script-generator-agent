Introduction
------------

The **Script Generator Agent** is a powerful application designed to generate highly detailed film or music video scripts. It leverages the **LangChain library** and **OpenAI API** to create scripts, including character descriptions, settings, and mood.

This agent is integrated with **Nevermined's Payments API**, which provides:

*   **Task lifecycle management**: Efficiently handle task creation, updates, and completion.
*   **Billing integration**: Utilize subscription plans (DIDs) to manage balance and execute tasks.
*   **Event subscription**: React to events like task updates in real-time.

The agent receives input ideas as tasks, processes them into fully detailed scripts, and then updates the Nevermined task system with the results.

One of the standout features of this integration is the **absence of server-side complexity**:
- **No custom server setup**: The Nevermined platform handles all API calls and client requests.
- **Event-driven architecture**: The agent listens for task updates and processes them automatically.
- **Seamless integration**: Tasks and billing are managed via the Payments API.

By subscribing to events with the `subscribe` method, the agent is notified of task requests, processes them through a callback, and sends updates back to the platform.

Integration with Nevermined Payments API
----------------------------------------

This agent is designed to work within the **Nevermined ecosystem**, leveraging the **Payments API** for managing tasks and billing. Below is a step-by-step guide to integrate an agent with Nevermined:

1.  **Initialize the Payments Instance**: The Payments instance provides access to the Nevermined task system.
    
    ```typescript
    import { Payments, EnvironmentName } from "@nevermined-io/payments";
    
    const payments = Payments.getInstance({
      nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY!,
      environment: process.env.NVM_ENVIRONMENT as EnvironmentName,
    });
    
    if (!payments.isLoggedIn) {
      throw new Error("Failed to authenticate with Nevermined.");
    }
    ```
    
2.  **Subscribe to Task Updates**: The agent subscribes to task updates using the `subscribe` method:
    
    ```typescript
    const subscriptionOpts = {
      joinAccountRoom: false,
      joinAgentRooms: [process.env.AGENT_DID!],
      subscribeEventTypes: ["step-updated"],
      getPendingEventsOnSubscribe: false,
    };
    
    await payments.query.subscribe(run, subscriptionOpts);
    ```
    
3.  **Task Lifecycle**:
    
    *   Fetch the step details:
        
        ```typescript
        const step = await payments.query.getStep(stepId);
        ```
        
    *   Update the step status:
        
        ```typescript
        await payments.query.updateStep(step.did, {
          step_status: "Completed",
          output: "Generated script content",
        });
        ```

   Once a task is received:
   - The step details are fetched using the `getStep` method.
   - The agent processes the task, such as generating a script.
   - The status is updated using the `updateStep` method.

How to create your own agent
--------
### 1\. Subscribing to Task Requests

The core functionality begins with subscribing to events using the `subscribe` method in `main.ts`:
```typescript
await payments.query.subscribe(run, {
  joinAccountRoom: false,
  joinAgentRooms: [process.env.AGENT_DID!],
  subscribeEventTypes: ["step-updated"],
  getPendingEventsOnSubscribe: false,
});
```

#### How It Works:
- **Event Subscription**: The `subscribe` method ensures the agent listens for task updates.
- **Callback Execution**: The `run` function is executed each time a task request is made.

### 2. Handling Task Lifecycle

The agent processes incoming tasks through the `run` function in `main.ts`:

```typescript
async function run(data: any) {
  const step = await payments.query.getStep(data.step_id);
  if (step.step_status !== "Pending") return;

  const idea = step.input_query; // Extract the idea
  const script = await scriptGenerator.generateScript(idea); // Generate the script

  await payments.query.updateStep(step.did, {
    ...step,
    step_status: "Completed",
    output: script,
  });
}
```

#### Key Points:

*   **Fetching step details**: Retrieve all task-related metadata.
*   **Generating output**: Use the `scriptGenerator` instance to generate content.
*   **Updating the step**: Mark the task as completed and provide the generated script.

* * *

### 3\. Generating Film Scripts with LangChain

The core script generation logic is in `scriptGenerator.ts`:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`
  Based on the following idea, generate a short film script including characters, their visual descriptions, and the setting:
  Idea: {idea}
`);

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});

export class ScriptGenerator {
  async generateScript(idea: string): Promise<string> {
    const script = await prompt.invoke({ idea });
    return script.trim();
  }
}
```

#### Key Features:
- **Custom Prompt**: Guides OpenAI to generate detailed scripts, including characters and settings.
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain for structured prompt handling and output parsing.

* * *

### 4\. Validating Steps and Sending Logs

The agent uses `logMessage` to send logs to the Nevermined system. This ensures task status updates are tracked:

The `logMessage` object should follow this structure:
```typescript
{
  task_id: string;   // Unique identifier for the task this log belongs to.
  level: "info" | "warning" | "error" | "debug";  // Log severity level.
  message: string;   // The log message content.
}
```

Example:
```typescript
logMessage(payments, {
  task_id: "task123",
  level: "info",
  message: "Processing step X successfully."
});
```

Use this to track progress, errors, or task completion.
